## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

These are some of the things that I have learned in the process of making this project.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

- I would like to practice more on my sass and css.
- Improve on flexbox and grid
- Make mobile first designs
- Practice more on my Javascript and React

### Useful resources

- [React Tutorial - Fundamentals, Hooks, Context API, React Router, Custom Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZhV0bILFb0&t=22814s) - This helped me learn the basics of react and the hooks to apply in such a project.The **useState** hook to be precise.
- [React Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3m6mv5qvg&t=1258s) - Consists of React projects: The Accordion being one of them.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge **_@coding addict_** who helped me know most of the things in react and when I felt like I was a bit stuck I checked on his tutorials and had some insight.
**_@WebDevSimplified_** also assisted me in some of his tutorials mostly in react hooks.
